It operates on the principle of \"diffraction before destruction,\" where ultra-short (femtosecond-duration) and extremely intense X-ray pulses from an XFEL are used to collect diffraction patterns from microcrystals or nanocrystals before the sample is destroyed by radiation damage. This allows for high-resolution structure determination at room temperature, avoiding the need for cryogenic cooling typically required in conventional X-ray crystallography.\n\nIn SFX, a continuous stream of randomly oriented protein crystals is delivered into the path of the XFEL beam. Each XFEL pulse interacts with a single crystal, producing a \"snapshot\" diffraction pattern. Since the pulse duration is shorter than the timescale of radiation damage, the diffraction data are collected before structural degradation occurs. Thousands to tens of thousands of such diffraction patterns are collected and merged computationally to reconstruct a complete three-dimensional electron density map, enabling accurate structure determination.\n\nSFX is particularly advantageous for studying challenging proteins such as membrane proteins, which are difficult to crystallize in large quantities and are sensitive to radiation damage. The technique has been successfully applied to solve structures of membrane-bound protein complexes, multi-subunit complexes, and proteins undergoing dynamic processes. It also supports time-resolved studies, such as pump–probe experiments, to capture structural changes during chemical reactions or light-induced processes.\n\nTo ensure efficient data collection, various crystal delivery systems have been developed, including liquid jets, lipidic cubic phase (LCP) injectors, agarose-based streams, and viscous media, which help reduce sample consumption and maintain crystal integrity during delivery.

INTRODUCTION\nX-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) are tunable and\nhighly versatile light sources, capable of generating coher-\nent radiation over a very broad spectral range. From tens of\nnanometers to a fraction of 1 angstrom, the peak power is in\nthe range of 10 to about 50 GW and the pulse duration from\na few to about 100 femtoseconds[1,2]. This versatility has\nrendered XFELs highly successful in a wide range of\nscientific applications. Among these are nonlinear x-ray\nphysics and the determination of structural information\nfrom biological samples, with recent experiments achieving\nangstrom level spatial and femtosecond time-scale reso-\nlution using x-ray diffraction imaging techniques. One of\nthe major goals for future XFELs is to further increase the\nresolution of these experiments in order to enable 3D\natomic resolution imaging of single molecules while\nmaintaining a short enough pulse duration to limit radiation\ndamage on the sample[3]. Recent unexpected results on\nnonlinear Compton scattering also show the interest in\nincreasing the peak power level and bring the electric field\nin the focused x-ray beam nearer to the Schwinger critical\nfield [4]. Both these applications require x-ray pulses with\npeak powers in the terawatt (TW) range.\nAn important parameter for FELs is the efficiency, the ratio\nof the FEL radiation power to the electron beam power. In the\nx-ray region the FEL efficiency is rather low, about10\n−3 at\nsaturation. Increasing the efficiency beyond the saturation\nvalue is possible by tapering the undulator magnetic field[5].\nThis has been examined theoretically [5,6], numerically\n[7–9] and demonstrated experimentally from the microwave\n[10] down to hard x-ray wavelengths[11]. At hard x-ray\nwavelengths the achieved efficiencies are a factor of 3 larger\nthan the exponential saturation value [11].

{"question_id": "basic_004", "question": "How does SASE work in X-ray FELs?", "answer": "SASE (Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission) is the default operating mode of x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and works through a process initiated by intrinsic shot noise in the electron beam. Here is a detailed explanation based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Initial Seed: Shot Noise**  \n   The process begins with the electron beam injected into the undulator. Due to random microscopic density variations at the sub-wavelength scale, the electron bunch exhibits a small intrinsic initial bunching, known as **shot noise**. This shot noise serves as the initial seed for the radiation emission.\n\n2. **Exponential Growth of Radiation**  \n   The shot noise triggers the exponential growth of radiation in the coupled electron-radiation system. As the electron beam travels through the undulator, the interaction between the electrons and the emitted radiation leads to microbunching of the electrons at the wavelength of the radiation. This microbunching enhances the radiation emission, resulting in a self-amplified process.\n\n3. **Role of Relative Slippage**  \n   The evolution of the longitudinal radiation pulse is strongly influenced by the **relative slippage** between the radiation and the electrons. This slippage occurs because the radiation travels slightly faster than the electrons in the undulator. The **co-operation length** $ l_c = \\lambda_r / (4\\pi\\rho) $, where $ \\lambda_r $ is the radiation wavelength and $ \\rho $ is the slippage parameter, defines the distance over which the radiation and electrons remain in phase and interact effectively.\n\n4. **Formation of Random Spikes**  \n   At saturation, the radiation pulse consists of a **random superposition of many spikes** with uncorrelated phases. The maximum peak-to-peak distance between these spikes is $ 2\\pi l_c $. This is because, for a sufficiently long electron beam ($ l_b \\gg 2\\pi l_c $), different regions along the beam develop independently from the localized noise source, leading to phase incoherence across the pulse.\n\n5. **Single-Spike Regime**  \n   If the electron bunch length $ l_b \\leq 2\\pi l_c $, only one SASE spike can develop. This regime is referred to as **weak superradiance** or **single-spike SASE**, and it results in a more coherent pulse compared to the multi-spike case.\n\n6. **Temporal Coherence Limitations**  \n   Despite achieving nearly perfect **transverse coherence**, SASE suffers from **poor longitudinal coherence** due to the random nature of the initial shot noise and the resulting uncorrelated spikes. This limits its use in experiments requiring high spectral purity and temporal coherence, such as high-resolution spectroscopy and quantum optics.\n\nIn summary, SASE operates by amplifying spontaneous emission from shot noise in the electron beam through a self-consistent interaction in the undulator, leading to intense, ultra-short x-ray pulses. However, the resulting radiation is inherently chaotic and has limited temporal coherence, which motivates the development of seeding techniques (e.g., self-seeding, cavity-based FELs) to achieve fully coherent x-ray output.", "sources": [{"title": "Short-wavelength free-electron laser sources and science: a review", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6633/aa7cca", "journal": "Reports on Progress in Physics", "year": 2017, "page": 11, "content": "Review\n11\noperating modes and the corresponding enhancements over \nthe properties given here are described in sections 3 and 4.\n2.8.1 .

Here the electron beam injected into the undu-\nlator has a small intrinsic initial bunching b\n0, due to random \nmicroscopic density variations in the electron bunch at the sub-\nwavelength scale. This initial bunching, termed shot noise, is \nalways sufficient to trigger exponential growth in the coupled \nelectron-radiation system. The further evolution of the longi-\ntudinal radiation pulse characteristics is then strongly depen-\ndent on the relative slippage between radiation and electrons. \nBy including this relative slippage in the FEL equations the \nsystem can be solved to show that at saturation the radiation \npulse comprises a random superposition of many spikes with \nuncorrelated phases [69]. The maximum peak-to-peak dis-\ntance between spikes is \n2πlc where the co-operation length\nlc = λr /(4πρ) (26)\nis the slippage in a gain length. A wavefront therefore prop-\nagates a distance lc through the electron beam per gain length \nand the co-operation length is seen to define the scale at which \ncollective effects evolve throughout the electron beam. For a \nsufficiently long electron beam, different regions along the \nbeam develop from the localised noise source autonomously \nand are therefore uncorrelated in phase. In this sense, the SASE \nprocess can be considered as a ‘localised’ collective process. \nTypically, in the x-ray the electron bunch length \nlb ≫ 2πlc , so \nthere are many random spikes in the radiation pulse which has \na total length similar to that of the electron bunch. If however \nthe electron bunch length \nlb ⩽ 2πlc only one SASE spike can \ndevelop and single spike output is possible. Such a regime is \nknown as weak superradiance or single-spike SASE [70, 71]."}, {"title": "Active Q-Switched X-Ray Regenerative Amplifier Free-Electron Laser", "doi": "10.1103/physrevlett.131.055001", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": 2023, "page": 0, "content": "power electron beams to an array of FEL beamlines, with\neach FEL specialized for a certain class of experiments but\nall operating at a relatively high repetition rate.

Each particle produces a diffraction pattern on a detector placed in the far field, and these patterns are collected from millions of randomly oriented particles. By combining and analyzing these diffraction patterns, a full 3D diffraction image is reconstructed computationally, which can then be used to derive the 3D electron density of the target object.\n\nSPI is a form of coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), also known as \"lensless imaging,\" because it does not rely on traditional lenses to form an image. Instead, the structure is retrieved through computational algorithms that reconstruct the object from the diffraction data. The technique is particularly powerful for studying biological samples in their native, solution-state environment, as it avoids the need for freezing (as in cryo-electron microscopy) and can capture structures at physiological temperatures.\n\nSPI experiments typically involve sample delivery systems such as aerodynamic-focusing injectors or electrospray ionization (ESI) techniques, which deliver particles into the X-ray beam in a controlled manner. The method is especially suited for studying heterogeneous samples, although challenges remain in handling sample heterogeneity, radiation damage, solvent effects, and background noise. Recent advances, including unsupervised learning algorithms and improved data classification methods, are helping to address these challenges and enable high-resolution reconstructions, even from complex or variable samples.\n\nSPI is a key component of the broader effort to achieve near-atomic resolution (e.g., 3 Å) structures of single biomolecules, and it is being actively developed at facilities such as the European XFEL (SPB/SFX instrument), LCLS (AMO beamline), and other XFEL facilities worldwide.", "sources": [{"title": "Coherent diffractive imaging of proteins and viral capsids: simulating MS SPIDOC", "doi": "10.1007/s00216-023-04658-y", "journal": "Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry", "year": 2023, "page": 1, "content": "Kierspel T. et al.\n1 3\nthese techniques are all very powerful and useful, each of \nthem has its own strengths and weaknesses ranging from \nlimitations of molecular size, through predominantly static \nsnapshots of dynamic structures to bias towards highly abun-\ndant and energetically more favorable species.\nIn a novel approach, we aim to use MS techniques as \nsample delivery for imaging techniques like coherent dif-\nfractive imaging (CDI) to combine the advantages of both \napproaches.

{"question_id": "basic_008", "question": "What is the difference between SASE and seeded FEL?", "answer": "The differences between SASE (Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission) FELs and seeded FELs lie in their generation mechanisms, spectral and temporal properties, coherence, stability, and tunability. Below is a detailed comparison based on the provided context:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Generation Mechanism**\n- **SASE FEL**: Relies on the spontaneous emission of radiation from an electron beam, which is then amplified through the interaction with the undulator. The process starts from noise and builds up coherently over the length of the undulator. This stochastic process leads to random fluctuations in the radiation output.\n  - *Reference*: Document 6 states: \"The spectral and temporal profiles are typically composed of a series of randomly distributed spikes, reflecting the stochastic nature of the SASE generation process that is amplification of noise.\"\n\n- **Seeded FEL**: Uses an external coherent laser source (e.g., CO₂, Ti:Sa, or their harmonics) to seed the FEL process. The electron beam interacts with this pre-existing coherent radiation, leading to a more deterministic and controlled amplification.\n  - *Reference*: Document 6: \"Seeding with a coherent external source provides an alternative to the SASE basic scheme.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Spectral Bandwidth and Coherence**\n- **SASE FEL**:\n  - Has a relatively **broad spectral bandwidth** (on the order of a few percent of the photon energy).\n  - Example: The rms bandwidth of SASE radiation at PAL-XFEL is **15 eV**.\n  - Limited **longitudinal coherence** due to the stochastic nature of the amplification process.\n  - *Reference*: Document 2: \"The rms bandwidth of the SASE radiation is 15 eV.\"\n\n- **Seeded FEL**:\n  - Produces radiation with a **narrower spectral bandwidth** (e.g., **0.78 eV** at PAL-XFEL).\n  - Exhibits **high temporal coherence** because the output inherits the coherence properties of the seed laser.\n  - *Reference*: Document 2: \"The rms bandwidth of the seeded FEL radiation is 0.78 eV.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Intensity and Timing Fluctuations**\n- **SASE FEL**:\n  - Suffers from **large intensity fluctuations** and **timing jitter**.\n  - These fluctuations require post-acquisition data sorting for pump-probe experiments.\n  - *Reference*: Document 6: \"The resulting intensity fluctuations and timing jitter impose post-acquisition sorting data for pump-probe time-resolved studies.\"\n\n- **Seeded FEL**:\n  - Shows **very limited intensity fluctuations** and **reduced timing jitter**.\n  - The pulse is locked to an external signal, enabling precise temporal synchronization.\n  - *Reference*: Document 4: \"The output properties of a seeded FEL directly reflect the seed laser’s attributes, which ensures a high degree of temporal coherence and small pulse energy fluctuations with respect to SASE.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Tunability and Flexibility**\n- **SASE FEL**:\n  - Tunability is limited and typically requires **fine-tuning of the electron beam energy**, which is laborious.\n  - Fixed undulators restrict the ability to scan photon energy across absorption edges easily.\n  - *Reference*: Document 1: \"Due to the fact that the existing SASE FELs have fixed undulators, the photon energy scanning can be realized only by fine-tuning the electron beam energy, the making of this operation is quite laborious.\"\n\n- **Seeded FEL**:\n  - Easier to tune via **variable gap undulators**, allowing flexible and precise control over the photon energy.\n  - *Reference*: Document 1: \"Conversely, XAS experiments at seeded FELs are easier, for the photon energy can easily be tuned via the variable gap undulators.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Performance in Pump-Probe Experiments**\n- **SASE FEL**:\n  - Challenging for time-resolved experiments due to intensity and timing fluctuations.\n  - Requires data sorting and averaging over many shots.\n  - *Reference*: Document 6: \"Intensity fluctuations and timing jitter impose post-acquisition sorting data for pump-probe time-resolved studies.\"\n\n- **Seeded FEL**:\n  - Superior for pump-probe experiments due to **better synchronization**, **lower jitter**, and **higher coherence**.\n  - Enables higher spectral and temporal resolution.\n  - *Reference*: Document 4: \"This allows more precise temporal synchronization, which is especially important for pump–probe experiments.\"\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Saturation and Efficiency**\n- **SASE FEL**:\n  - Saturation length is longer, limiting the effectiveness of post-saturation tapering.\n  - Poor longitudinal coherence limits the usable undulator length for tapering.\n  - *Reference*: Document 5: \"In the latter case, a poor longitudinal coherence limits the length of the tapered part of the undulator to a length on which a slippage of the radiation with respect to the electron beam is comparable with the FEL coherence length.\"\n\n- **Seeded FEL**:\n  - Better performance in post-saturation tapering due to higher coherence.\n  - More efficient use of undulator length for power enhancement.\n  - *Reference*: Document 5: \"A seeded (self-seeded) FEL works better in the post-saturation tapering regime than SASE FEL.\"\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Feature | SASE FEL | Seeded FEL |\n|--------|----------|------------|\n| **Bandwidth** | Broad (~few %, e.g., 15 eV) | Narrow (e.g., 0.78 eV) |\n| **Coherence** | Low longitudinal coherence | High temporal coherence |\n| **Intensity Fluctuations** | Large | Very limited |\n| **Timing Jitter** | High | Low |\n| **Tunability** | Difficult (requires beam energy tuning) | Easy (via variable gap undulators) |\n| **Synchronization** | Poor | Excellent (locked to external seed) |\n| **Pump-Probe Suitability** | Challenging | Ideal |\n| **Saturation & Tapering** | Limited by coherence | More effective due to better coherence |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nSeeded FELs offer significant advantages over SASE FELs in terms of **spectral purity, temporal coherence, stability, tunability, and suitability for time-resolved experiments**. While SASE FELs are simpler to implement and widely used, seeded FELs provide a more controlled and high-quality X-ray source, especially for advanced applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy and coherent imaging.", "sources": [{"title": "Time resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy in condensed matter: A road map to the future", "doi": "10.1016/j.elspec.2015.06.014", "journal": "Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena", "year": 2015, "page": 2, "content": "principles. The main differences between the X-rays produced by\nthese two sources are the energy bandwidth of the pulse and the\npulse stability in terms of intensity, photon energy and bandwidth.\nSASE FELs produce ultrashort X-ray pulses with a few percent band-\nwidth and large intensity ﬂuctuations. For these sources also the\ntunability of the photon energy is, so far, difﬁcult. On the contrary\nseeded FELs are characterized by a narrow frequency bandwidth\n/Delta1ω/ω (few percent), a very limited intensity ﬂuctuations [42] and\nan easier tunability. Therefore, XAS experiments at SASE FELs are\nchallenging. The main requested performance for such experi-\nments is the tunability of the incoming photon energy across an\nabsorption edge of the material under investigation. Due to the\nfact that the existing SASE FELs have ﬁxed undulators, the photon\nenergy scanning can be realized only by ﬁne-tuning the electron\nbeam energy, the making of this operation is quite laborious. So\nin practice only the intrinsic bandwidth of the FEL is used to map\nan absorption edge. Conversely, XAS experiments at seeded FELs\nare easier, for the photon energy can easily be tuned via the vari-\nable gap undulators [53]. In the following we will present some\nexamples of XAS measurements on solid samples using SASE FELs\nand seeded FELS.\nThe bandwidth of SASE FELs (that is of the order of few % of the\nphoton energy) is some times advantageous to perform XAS exper-\niments.

An alternative way to improve the\nlongitudinal coherence of SASE is to enhance the FEL\nslippage, which provides an in situ method for communi-\ncating phase information over larger portions of the elec-\ntron beam. Several techniques based on this principle, such\nas high-brightness SASE [ 53], improved SASE [ 54],\npuriﬁed SASE [ 55], and harmonic lasing self-seeding\n(HLSS) [ 56], have been developed. Recent results of HLSS\nat FLASH have demonstrated that the spectral bandwidth\nof SASE can be reduced by several times [ 57]; this result is\nnot as good as that obtained by self-seeding but can still\nsigniﬁcantly increase the spectral brightness. Unlike that of\nself-seeding, the central wavelength of slippage-boosted\nSASE is still determined by the electron beam energy,\nwhich results in ﬂuctuation of the central wavelength from\nshot to shot. However, the advantage of slippage-boosted\nSASE is that the output pulse energy is insensitive to the\nbeam energy ﬂuctuation.\n3.2 Seeded FELs\nThe temporal coherence and intrinsic pulse energy\nﬂuctuations of the SASE and self-seeding schemes can be\nfurther improved by using seeded FELs with external seed\nlasers.

Compared to self-\nseeding, seeding with external lasers has an additional\nadvantage in that the FEL pulse is locked to an external\nsignal. This allows more precise temporal synchronization,\nwhich is especially important for pump–probe experiments.\nThe schematic layouts of the main types of seeded FELs\nare given in Fig. 6.\nThe straightforward seeded FEL, which is called a\ndirectly seeded FEL, is illustrated in Fig. 6a.

It is well-\nknown [40] that a seeded (self-seeded) FEL works better in\nthe post-saturation tapering regime than SASE FEL. In the\nlatter case, a poor longitudinal coherence limits the length\nof the tapered part of the undulator to a length on which a\nslippage of the radiation with respect to the electron beam is\ncomparable with the FEL coherence length[41,42].I na\nself-seeded FEL the coherence length is much larger and it\ndoes not limit the performance of the tapered FEL (unless a\nsideband instability starts playing a role[36]). A disad-\nvantage of a self-seeded FEL is that the saturation length is\nalmost doubled with respect to the SASE regime, so that the\navailable length for tapering the undulator may become too\nshort.

{"question_id": "basic_009", "question": "What sample delivery methods are used in SFX experiments?", "answer": "In serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) experiments, several sample delivery methods are employed to ensure the efficient and stable introduction of microcrystals into the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) beam. These methods are crucial for achieving high data collection efficiency, especially given the extremely short and intense X-ray pulses that destroy the sample upon interaction.\n\nThe primary sample delivery methods used in SFX experiments include:\n\n1. **Gas-Dynamic Virtual Nozzle (GDVN)**:  \n   This is the most common and widely used method in SFX. It involves a coaxial arrangement where a liquid stream containing microcrystals is delivered through a small inner capillary, while a high-pressure gas sheath flows through a larger outer capillary. The gas focuses the liquid stream into a fine, elongated jet with a diameter of a few micrometers, matching the X-ray beam focus. This method enables the delivery of hydrated protein crystals in a liquid matrix across the XFEL beam. However, it requires careful control of flow velocity and jet stability, and the jet is prone to clogging, especially with large or aggregated crystals. To mitigate this, sample filtering and inline filters are often used. The GDVN method is suitable for high repetition rate XFELs but leads to high sample consumption because most crystals do not interact with the X-ray pulses due to the fast flow rate (typically ~10 m/s).\n\n2. **Droplet Injection Method**:  \n   This method delivers discrete droplets of the sample solution into the X-ray beam. It has been successfully applied in SFX experiments, such as the determination of the lysozyme structure at SACLA, where a complete dataset was collected in about 30 minutes using less than 0.3 mg of sample. Droplet injection reduces sample consumption compared to continuous jets and is particularly useful for experiments requiring precise timing or limited sample availability.\n\n3. **High-Viscosity Injectors (e.g., Lipidic Cubic Phase, LCP)**:  \n   These are used for delivering crystals grown in viscous media, such as lipidic cubic phase (LCP), which is especially effective for membrane proteins. The high viscosity of the carrier allows for much slower sample flow (approximately 10 mm/s), enabling longer delay times (up to several tenths of milliseconds) between the pump laser pulse and the X-ray probe pulse in time-resolved SFX (TR-SFX). This is critical for studying slow structural dynamics. Other viscous carriers, such as grease or hydroxyethyl cellulose, have also been used. However, challenges include potential instability in flow and the risk of multiple sample illuminations or inaccurate delay times.\n\n4. **Fixed-Target Methods**:  \n   These methods involve immobilizing crystals on a solid substrate (e.g., a chip or grid) and scanning them through the X-ray beam. This approach is particularly useful for experiments requiring minimal sample consumption and is compatible with the repetition rates of existing XFEL sources. Microfluidic flow cells are also being explored for precious or limited protein samples.\n\n5. **Coaxial Sheath Liquid Injection**:  \n   This technique uses a sheath liquid to stabilize and guide the sample stream, helping to reduce sample consumption even in continuous-flow liquid jets. It is especially beneficial in maintaining jet stability and minimizing dispersion.\n\n6. **Microfluidic Flow Cells**:  \n   These are used for experiments with extremely limited sample amounts, such as precious protein samples. They allow precise control over sample delivery and are compatible with various injection strategies.\n\nIn summary, the choice of sample delivery method depends on the experimental goals (e.g., static vs. time-resolved), sample type (e.g., hydrophilic vs. lipophilic crystals), available sample quantity, and the repetition rate of the XFEL source. As high-repetition-rate XFELs like SHINE come online, adaptations of these methods—such as improved synchronization, reduced sample consumption, and enhanced stability—are being actively developed to meet the demands of next-generation SFX experiments.", "sources": [{"title": "Strategies for sample delivery for femtosecond crystallography", "doi": "10.1107/s2059798318017953", "journal": "Acta Crystallographica Section D Structural Biology", "year": 2019, "page": 1, "content": "A key requirement for SFX is adequate delivery of the\nsample into the XFEL beam.

Therefore, to most\nefﬁciently collect a data set, fresh sample must be brought into\nthe beam between X-ray pulses, requiring a sample-exchange\nrate that matches the repetition rate of the XFEL source.\nTable 1 provides a quick reference to the beam characteristics\nand sample-delivery methods available currently or in the\nnear future at all XFEL facilities worldwide. The chosen X-ray\nrepetition rate depends on the experimental setup and the\ncapabilities of the respective XFEL facility.

Introduction \n1.1 Sample delivery in serial femtosecond crystallography \nWith peak intensities that are 10 8 – 10 10 times greater than those of synchrotron sources [1] \nand the ability to out-run radiation damage, the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) has enabled \nnovel methodological advances in protein crystallography using serial femtosecond \ncrystallography (SFX) [2,3]. Using a liquid stream containing micron or submicron sized \nhydrated protein crystals running across a pulsed hard X-ray laser beam, snapshot X-ray \ndiffraction patterns from protein microcrystals are recorded and read out at 120 Hz, \nfacilitating sub-picosecond time-resolved diffraction studies at room temperature [4]. Sample \ndelivery in SFX therefore requir es transporting millions of sensitive protein crystals of \nsubmicron dimensions, often in high vacuum, across the pathway of the pulsed X-ray beam. \nThis can be achieved using a liquid jet formed in a Gas Dynamic Virtual Nozzle (GDVN), \nwhich focuses a liquid stream of a suitable buffer  solution containing the crystals into the X-\nray beam. The sample delivery requirement for SFX is to use a physical nozzle large enough \nto avoid clogging by bioparticles, yet fine en ough to match the diameter of the X-ray beam \nfocus, which is about 1 micron. As demonstrated by Gañán-Calvo [5] and later refined for \nSFX by DePonte et al. [6], this can be achieved by using an outer high pressure coaxial gas \nsheath to speed up a liquid stream through gas focusing to produce a much finer liquid stream"}, {"title": "Fluid sample injectors for x-ray free electron laser at SACLA", "doi": "10.1017/hpl.2017.6", "journal": "High Power Laser Science and Engineering", "year": 2017, "page": 4, "content": "Fluid sample injectors for x-ray free electron laser at SACLA 5\nThe droplet method was successfully applied to SFX.\nMafun´e et al. determined the structure of lysozyme at a\nresolution of 0.23 nm from crystals with an average size of\n∼5 µm. A complete dataset was obtained in ∼30 min with a\nsample amount less than 0.3 mg.\n4. Summary and outlook\nThe ﬂuid sample injectors at SACLA have facilitated experi-\nments in the way of ‘diffract before destroy’ by working with\nthe diverse experimental platforms such as DAPHNIS and\nMAXIC. They are especially playing a key role in protein\nSFX using the DAPHNIS system. After the successful\ndemonstrations of the liquid-jet injectors, the viscous carrier\ninjector and the droplet injector expanded the opportunity of\nSFX to a wide variety of proteins. Now both lipophilic and\nhydrophilic crystals can be measured with a reasonably small\namount.\nThe increasing demands for SFX lead to the further devel-\nopment of sample delivery methods which will enable data\nacquisition in a short time with a reduced sample amount.\nA ﬁxed target method is now capable of delivering crystals\nat the repetition rates of the existing XFEL sources [50].\nMicroﬂuidic ﬂow cells would be useful for precious protein\nsamples[51, 52]. Sample injection with a coaxial sheath liquid\ncan help to suppress a sample amount even in the case of\ncontinuous-ﬂow liquid jet[34].\nThe developments in sample delivery methods add new ca-\npabilities to the experimental systems. Time-resolved SFX,\nfor example, is becoming a common technique for studying\ndynamics of proteins[53, 54]. In this technique, delivery tools\nshould be compatible with sample activation techniques such\nas optical pulse irradiation and fast mixing of reactant and\nsample solutions[33, 34].\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks members of the SACLA Science Research\nGroup and the Engineering Team of RIKEN SPring-8 Center\nfor providing the ﬁgures and the table in this paper.

LCLS-II-HE Technical Capabilities\n• Access to the energy regime above 5 keVfor the analysis of key chemical elements and for atomic\nresolution. This regime encompasses Earth-abundant elements that are expected to comprise\nfuture photocatalysts for electricity and fuel production; it also accesses elements with strong\nspin-orbit coupling that are of signiﬁcant interest for future quantum materials; and it reaches the\nbiologically important selenium K-edge for phasing in protein crystallography.\n• High-repetition-rate, ultrafast hard X-rays from LCLS-II-HE will reveal coupled atomic and\nelectronic dynamics in unprecedented detail. Advanced X-ray techniques will simultaneously\nmeasure electronic structure and subtle nuclear displacements at the atomic scale, on fundamental\ntimescales (femtosecond and longer), and in operating environments that require the penetrating\ncapabilities of hard X-rays and the sensitivity provided by high repetition rate.\n• Temporal resolution: LCLS-II-HE will deliver coherent X-rays on the fastest timescales,\nopening up experimental opportunities that were previously unattainable due to low\nsignal-to-noise from LCLS (at 120 Hz) and that are simply not possible on non-laser sources.\nThe performance of LCLS has progressed from initial pulse durations of 300 fs down to 5 fs,\ncoupled to the capability for double pulses with independent control of energy, bandwidth,\nand timing. Ongoing development programs offer the potential for 0.5 fs pulses."}], "rewritten_query": null, "generation_time": 7.6374030113220215, "timestamp": "2025-12-30T23:03:00.247098", "metadata": {"category": "facility", "difficulty": "intermediate", "expected_topics": ["LCLS-II", "repetition rate", "MHz"]}}
